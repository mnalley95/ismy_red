        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>
          People have different names for the colors they see.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir%E2%80%93Whorf_hypothesis" target="_blank"
            >Language can affect how we memorize and name colors</a
          >. This is a color naming test designed to measure your personal red-yellow boundary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The test focuses on red-yellow hues between 15 and 45 degrees in HSL color space. Hue 0/360 is red, and hue 60 is yellow. The test uses your responses to determine where you draw the boundary between these colors.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Color perception is tricky to measure--vision scientists use specialized calibrated
          equipment to measure color perception. Graphic designers use physical color cards, such as
          those
          <a
            href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/19/1197961103/pantone-colors-lawrence-herbert-stuart-semple-standards"
            >made by Pantone</a
          >, so that they can communicate colors unambiguously. Here we use your monitor or phone to
          test how you categorize colors, which is far from perfect, since your calibration may
          differ from mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The validity of the inference is limited by the calibration of your monitor, ambient
          lighting, and filters such as night mode. Despite these limitations, the results should
          have good test-retest reliability <i>on the same device, in the same ambient light</i>,
          which you can verify by taking the test multiple times. If you want to compare your
          results with friends, use the same device in the same ambient light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting outlier results doesn't mean there's anything wrong with your vision. It might
          mean you have an idiosyncratic way of naming colors, or that your monitor and lighting is
          unusual.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>
          The test asks you to categorize colors sequentially. Colors are often represented in HSL
          (hue, saturation, lightness) color space. Hue 120 is green, and hue 240 is blue. The test
          focuses on blue-green hues between 150 and 210. On the web, HSL coordinates are translated
          to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB color space</a>, the standard color
          space of the web, which is not perceptually uniform. These sRGB values are translated
          nonlinearly to your monitor through a gamma curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          The test assumes that your responses between blue and green are represented by a sigmoid
          curve. It sequentially fits that sigmoid curve to your responses:
        </p>

        <img src="@/assets/formula.svg" alt="Formula" />
        <br />
        <p>
          This is equivalent to a logistic regression model. The test uses a maximum-a-posteriori
          (MAP) estimation algorithm (specifically, a second order Newton method implemented in pure
          JS, no calls to a backend) to fit the sigmoid curve to your responses, with a vague prior
          on the scale and offset parameters. It uses the fitted curve to determine which color will
          be presented next. It tries to be smart about where it samples new points, focusing on
          regions where you're predicted to be intermediately confident in your responses. To
          improve the validity of the results, it randomizes which points it samples, and uses a
          noise mask to mitigate visual adaptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a curve fit, not a binary search. In theory, if you feel like you're guessing in the
          middle shades, or even guessing incorrectly, that should be fine. If you're inconsistent
          in the middle, the curve fit should be able to recover, although your estimated threshold
          will have larger error bars.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          In early experiments, we found that people's responses cluster around 175, which
          coincidentally is the same as the named HTML color turquoise
          <span class="color-chip-turquoise mr-1"></span>. This is interesting, because the nominal
          boundary between blue and green is at 180, the named HTML color cyan
          <span class="color-chip-cyan mr-1"></span>. That means most people's boundaries are
          shifted toward saying that cyan is blue.
        </p>
        <h2>What information does this website collect?</h2>
        <p>
          This website collects aggregate usage metrics to understand how many people use the site
          and when. Since we received plenty of responses to the test, we have closed data
          submission.
